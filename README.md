## Styling

The content of [custom.css](./custom.css) can be pasted into the *Custom CSS*.

This style fills in a prettier way the bottom part of the left column.

It also fixes some shortcomings of the "advanced" view:

* content stuck to the left side of the window
* too thin columns even when there's a lot of room
* hidden columns when the window isn't wide enough
